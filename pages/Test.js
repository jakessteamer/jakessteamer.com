        <p>
          Steaming your carpet on a regular basis is the best way to clean
          deeply, and remove stubborn stains. With a steam cleaning machine, hot
          water is forced through the vacuum hose deep into the carpet backing.
          This hot water dissolves stubborn, ground-in stains, dust mites and
          other allergens trapped deep within the carpet fibers. In addition to
          dislodging dirt and allergens, steaming also kills mold spores,
          bacteria and other pathogens. Steaming your carpet will leave it
          cleaner than a typical cleaning method, and with reduced allergens
          that may be harmful to your familyâ€™s health.
