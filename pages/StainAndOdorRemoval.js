          How To Remove Pet Stains and Odors
        </h2>
        <p className="section--heading">
          Fixing The Surprises Our Pets Leave Us

        <p>
          For many dog and cat owners, pet odor removal from carpets is an
          unfortunate fact of life. Puppies and kittens have a tendency to mess
          up flooring quite a bit before they are properly trained, and by the
          time they’re going outside or in the litter box, the floor may
          resemble a warzone.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are, however, a few ways a homeowner can wipe out the smells and
          stains that animals leave behind. In some cases, a professional may be
          needed to handle a particularly difficult and soiled situation.
        </p>
        {/* <p>
          The first thing to do when attempting pet odor removal is to locate
          the problem area on the carpet. This is often easier said than done,
          as dark flooring can make the area practically invisible. If finding
          the spot is too hard to do with the naked eye, illuminate the area
          with a black light. This type of bulb will highlight areas where
          Fluffy or Spot have been doing their business and will make give a
          starting spot when it comes to tackling the problem.
        </p> */}
        <p>
          Another way to track down soiled spots is to watch how other animals
          track through the home. If there are multiple dogs or cats in the
          house, they will stop and thoroughly investigate and sniff any area
          where other animals have evacuated. Animals have a tendency to use the
          bathroom where they detect the scent of urine or feces, so the problem
          could snowball and training the pup or kitten will be that much more
          difficult.
        </p>
        <p className="font-bold text-blue-500">
          Treating Pet Spots Until Help Arrives
        </p>
        <p>
          Pet odor removal must also be done immediately because if the soiled
          patch of carpet is allowed to sit for too long, it will require more
          dramatic methods to get rid of it. If the animals are allowed to soil
          the flooring for weeks at a time, and the fabric is not cleaned
          thoroughly every time, the carpet may need to be replaced.The best way
          to approach pet odor removal is to clean from the outside of the stain
          to the center.
        </p>
        <p>
          Starting from the center may push the stain out further and deeper
          into the flooring. Scrub inward with a bristle brush and paper towels.
          Use the paper towels to absorb liquid, and don’t scrub with them, as
          they may tear and get intertwined with carpet fibers.
